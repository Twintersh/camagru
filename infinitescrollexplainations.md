Sure! Here's what **"fetch pictures in chronological order, limited per request"** means — broken down simply, with a visual and practical explanation:

---

### 📦 1. **Your goal:**

You want to create an **infinite scroll feed** (like Instagram) that:
- Shows the **latest pictures first**.
- Loads **more pictures as you scroll** (not all at once).
- Avoids performance issues by **limiting** how many pictures are fetched at a time.

---

### ⏳ 2. **Chronological order**

That means sorting your pictures **by date** — newest first:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pictures
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

This will return the most recently added pictures first.

---

### 🔢 3. **Limited per request**

You don't want to load **every picture at once** — it’d be slow and heavy. Instead, you load a small number per request, like 10 or 20.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pictures
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

- `LIMIT 10` → get only 10 pictures.
- `OFFSET 0` → start at the first picture.

Then when the user scrolls, you send another request like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pictures
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10
```

And so on…

---

### 🔁 4. **How it works with infinite scroll**

1. You load the first 10 pictures normally on page load.
2. When the user scrolls near the bottom, you use **JavaScript (AJAX)** to:
   - Call a PHP file like `load_more.php?page=2`
   - That PHP returns the **next 10 pictures** from the database
3. You append those to your feed without refreshing the page.

---

### 🔧 5. **A simple example in PHP**

```php
$page = isset($_GET['page']) ? (int)$_GET['page'] : 1;
$limit = 10;
$offset = ($page - 1) * $limit;

$pictures = $db->execSqlQuery(
    "SELECT * FROM pictures ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?",
    [$limit, $offset]
);
```

---

### 👀 So in summary:

- You're **sorting by `created_at`** (`ORDER BY created_at DESC`)
- You're **limiting the number of results** (`LIMIT 10`)
- And you're **changing the offset** each time (`OFFSET X`) to fetch more as needed

Wanna try implementing the `load_more.php` part or the JavaScript next?
